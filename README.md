# Recipe Finder API

A RESTful API that allows users to search for recipes based on ingredients they have on hand. The application will use a public recipe API ([Spoonacular API](https://spoonacular.com/food-api)) to retrieve recipe data and return it to the user in a user-friendly format.

## Features

- Users can search for recipes by entering a list of ingredients they have on hand.
- The application will return a list of recipes that can be made with those ingredients, along with a link to the recipe and a photo.
- Users can filter the results by dietary restrictions, such as vegetarian or gluten-free.
- The application will include authentication and authorization, allowing users to create accounts and save their favorite recipes.
- The application will have a clean and intuitive API documentation using tools like Swagger or Postman.
